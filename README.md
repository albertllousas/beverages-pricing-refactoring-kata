# Beverage refactoring kata 

## Description

Kata to practice refactoring away from a bad inheritance usage.

Kotlin version of the kata from [here](https://github.com/trikitrok/beverages_pricing_refactoring_kata)

## Goal
This code computes the prices of the beverages served in our coffee house.

We'd like you to add an optional cinnamon supplement that costs 0.05â‚¬
to all our existing catalog of beverages.

### Tips:
You might want to refactor the code a bit first.
